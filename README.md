# Research code repository

Here I collect and organise the code developed as part of my research.

Each subdirectory is associated one-to-one to a specific work and it includes the simulation scripts, postprocessing routines and plotting utilities for reproducibility.

In each subdirectory a `README` file explains the main content of the project and provides a description of each experiment in `exp/`.

If you are interested in one particular work you can follow one of the links listed below:
