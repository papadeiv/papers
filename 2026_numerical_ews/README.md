## 📦 Structure of the repo

This repository is organised as follows

```bash
root/
├── doc/                # LaTeX source code and compiled PDF of the arXiv preprint 
├── exp/                # Collection of subdirectories associated one-to-one to an experiment/figure in the paper 
├── res/                # Figures and data generated by the scripts in the subdirs of exp/  
├── src/                # Modules collecting the source code of the experiments 
├── test/               # (When present) unit testing of the functions in utils/ 
└── utils/              # Functions used to implement the algorithms used to generate the res/ 
```

### ⚙️🛠️ Organisation of the experiments

In `exp` you'll find many subdirs, each associated one-to-one with an important experiment and/or a picture in the paper. The organisation of the code in each subdir follows the following structure

```bash
experiment/
├── scripts/             
│   ├── figs.jl         # Customise the layouts of the figures
│   ├── plot.jl         # Create the plots in each figure
│   ├── proc.jl         # Postprocess the results of a simulation (usually this is the main algorithm)
│   └── sim.jl          # Definition of the system and settings of the problem
├── inc.jl              # Load the modules in src/ and include all the other libraries
└── main.jl             # File to run to execute the simulation, analyse the results and export the figures
```

### 💡🔬 What does each experiment do?

What follows is a brief description of those experiments so that you can gather their functionalities without interpreting the code in it:

- [characterising_bad_runs](./exp/characterising_bad_runs/): in `main.jl` you'll find two main functions: `main()` and `characterise()`. By running `main()` first, out of an ensemble simulation of the same SDE at fixed parameter value, you'll extract those runs that results in a significantly bad or good reconstruction of the potential according to a criterion on the accurcay of the unstable equilibrium.
After that, by running `characterise()` you'll compute and display all the first 7 central moments of the empirical distribution of the above runs so to find statistical indicators that characterise bad runs from good runs.

- [ensemble_distribution](./exp/ensemble distribution/): compute and plot the empirical distribution of the quantities involved in the nonlinear reconstruction of the potential out of an ensemble of i.i.d. stationary particles (i.e. for a fixed parameter value).
