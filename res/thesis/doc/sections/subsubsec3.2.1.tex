\subsubsection{Intrinsic discrete phenomena}\label{subsubsec3.2.1}
As an intermediate step between low and high-dimensional problems, lattice dynamical systems (LDSs) have been investigated in the context of EWS detection. These are (large) systems of coupled ODEs organised on a $d-$dimensional regular lattice; each of such ODEs models the dynamics of the same observable $u$ at a given lattice site (node).
These systems are therefore intrisicly discrete in space while still retaining spatial heterogeneity via the coupling of the system.
As such one can use the temporal indicators derived above for low-dimensional systems while enriching the analysis by considering spatial statistics at each timestep of observation.
One specific model of interest has captived the efforts of recent works towards the construction of a robust theory of spatio-temporal EWS and that is the reaction-diffusion problem.
Given a $2-$dimensional rectangular lattice of $n\times m$ nodes, a generic reaction-diffusion problem perturbed by additive noise can be written, in cartesian coordinates, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.17}
     du_{j,k} = (D_{j,k}\,\phi(u_{j,k}, u_{j\pm1,k}, u_{j,k\pm1}) + R_{j,k}\,\psi(u_{j,k}))\,dt + \sigma\,dW_{j,k}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ represents the nearest-neighbour coupling modelling the diffusion component while $\psi$ is responsible for the reaction of $u$ at lattice site $(j,k)$.
A trivial transfortmation $\ell=n(k-1)+(j+1)$ allows us to recast \eqref{eq3.16} in linear coordinates
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.18}
     du_{\ell} = (D_{\ell}\,\phi(u_{\ell}, u_{\ell\pm1}, u_{\ell\pm n}) + R_{\ell}\,\psi(u_{\ell}))\,dt + \sigma\,dW_{\ell}\,,
\end{equation}
which is more convenient for our analysis.
The inclusion of a slowly-varying parameter $\mu$ in \eqref{eq3.18} completes our intermediate model to a more general case
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.19}
   \begin{cases}
      du_{\ell} = (D_{\ell}(\mu)\,\phi(u_{\ell}, u_{\ell\pm1}, u_{\ell\pm n}; \mu) + R_{\ell}(\mu)\,\psi(u_{\ell}; \mu))\,dt + \sigma\,dW_{\ell} \,, \\
      d\mu = \varepsilon\,dt \,. 
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We end this section by noticing that $D$ and $R$ are (generally inhomogeneous) scalar fields assigning relative (local) magnitudes to the diffusion and reaction phenomena respectively and they are paramount in the analysis of the onset of instabilities in these problems as addressed in the following Section.
