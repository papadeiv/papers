# Localised patterns of the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) in 2 dimensions

## 🚀 Description 

Time-dependent, reaction-diffusion equations are known to produce spatially patterned solutions as steady states [Peletier and Troy 2001](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0135-9).
A systematic way to characterise these solutions is to think of them as spatially localised patterns (pulses) that undergo homoclinic snaking in the bifurcation diagram of the spatial dynamics [Burke and Knobloch 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960106013612).
The LLE is a model from quantum physics that underpins the evolution of light pulses with several, important applications in nonlinear optics and laser models [Cardoso et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16981-3).
It has been empirically demonstrated [Parra-Rivas et al. 2018](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.042204) that the LLE in one spatial dimension does show homoclinic snaking of pulses in the energy injection (damping) parameter.
The existence and stability of these stationary pulses was recently proved in [Bengel et al. 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278925003999).

### ✏️📋 Outline

We investigate the existence of spatial pulse solutions for the LLE in a radially symmetric 2-dimensional domain.
The change of coordinates in the polar frame allows us to rewrite the Laplacian operator in a split-component fashion.
Because of the radial symmetry, we can parametrise the radial component of the Laplacian and perform a homotopy continuation for a spatial pulse in one dimension, to its counterpart in two dimensions.
We are able to perform a successfull homotopy continuation in the two dimensional polar domain and investigate the properties of its solution.

### 💡🔬 What does each experiment do?

What follows is a brief description of the numerical experiments so that you can understand their purpose without interpreting it from the code:

- `fig:snaking_1d`: bifurcation diagram in the L2-norm of steady-state solutions of the LLE in 1 dimension showing homoclinic snaking [[Parra-Rivas et al. 2018]](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.042204). Candidate solutions (yellow stars) are selected to continue them in the second dimension via homotopy.
