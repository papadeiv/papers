\section{Galor's model of growth}\label{sec:model}

In \cite{Galor00} a model of macroeconomic growth is proposed by Galor and Weil.
Part of such model consists of a \textit{``dynamical system''} \cite[Sec. 7.4, pp. 174--182]{Galor11} in discrete-time whose \textit{``time-paths''} should justify the techologically-driven development of societies.
We hereby briefly introduce the state variables and observables that are involved in the aforementioned dynamical system.
